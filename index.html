#### Spent the last 2 days in Chicago to...

... babysit my nieces, which is an absolute pleasure. I brought a bunch of tech stuff with me which was unnecessary. I also brought my guitar in some hope that somebody would want to listen/play. I tend to pack too much in optimism of good times.

spent today just wandering around Chicago and looking for cool stuff. I found a neighborhood I liked that seemed full of young not-poor people, couple of bars and tattoo shops and hair places. Seems like a vibe i could do for a summer.

Now just sitting in Starbucks charging up my phone and watch for the drive home. I hate the idea of hitting the road knowing it's a 3 hour drive home and my core navigational elements could be compromised. Paranoid in me I guess.

So I've got about 20-30 minutes to kill while I wait for the devices to charge. I think I'm going to keep poking at Ember and see if I can get anything interestint moving in this time.
