#### _Heading into 2024, I'll be taking on a new development role..._

I decided I'd like to track some of the new things I learn this coming year, as I'm hoping to get more exposure to the cybersecurity field, as well as working with more streaming data applications utilizing websockets and event-driven architecture.

For now, I'm going through picking up some new Javascript frameworks. I've been playing around with Deno a bit, and I like some of the changes over Node, but it still feels a bit fragile. Definitely something to keep looking at in the coming year, but I'm not sure I would make a recommendation for a money-generating application to make this change without clear and visible reasons.

I'm also looking at Ember.js front end framework. I started the quickstart app last night and my first impressions are:

* I like the opinionated nature of the CLI. It reminds me a bit of Vite and CRA (Create React App) CLI tools for scaffolding the application so you don't have to sit around generating structure and can get moving faster.

* The component structure seems nice, and the `generate` commands make setting up data model routing for components simple. It will be interesting to see how the Ember data sync async/await and fetch web api's that have become much more popular to framework data fetching in recent years.

* it feels a bit verbose to dump all the prettier/style/template rc files into the root directory. Maybe a way to update these extraneous config files into their own root directory?

* package is certainly loaded w/ ember packages, but thankfully they are all devDependencies and not runtime packages. Will have to ask the community how the package updcate process is like.

* nice to see plenty of linting jobs set up in package.json
